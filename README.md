# What's this

The source code responsible for https://nicolasoga.com.ar.
This is a single page application built with React.
Also integrates with Google and a GQL service to provide autentication and commenting for posts.

## Setup

~~~bash
yarn install
yarn start
~~~

You tweak some settings using environment variables, take a look at `.envrc`.

For commenting you'll need my [comments service](https://github.com/Nicolas-Oga/comments_service) running too.
