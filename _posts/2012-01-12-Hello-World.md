### Hello world!

I decided to host my blog using github pages and
[jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). This publishing platform is pretty cool for a programmer, since allows me to write my blog posts without leaving my favorite text editor.

There is some cool support for source code highlighting and other goodies:

{% highlight ruby %}
  alias shout puts

  10.times do
    shout "ruby is cool!"
  end
{% endhighlight %}

There. Nicely formatted source code. Pretty colors are pretty!
